                </div>
                <p class="section-content">The roar of bulldozers and the dust of construction sites once defined my world. As a heavy machinery operator, I spent years shaping roads and landscapes—until I realized I wanted to build something different: the future. Inspired by sci-fi’s bold visions of technology, I traded my hard hat for algorithms, driven by a passion to push boundaries in data and software. Today, as a data scientist and software engineer, I channel that same grit into solving complex problems, whether it’s optimizing systems or crafting elegant code. My mission? To leave a mark on the tech industry as indelible as the tire tracks I once left on dirt roads—proving that reinvention isn’t just possible; it’s powerful.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                </div>
                <p class="section-content">My journey to tech was anything but conventional. While traditional paths seemed out of reach, Moringa School became my launchpad. With no formal background in programming, I dove headfirst into data science, fueled by sheer determination and late-night coding sessions. The challenges were steep—juggling life responsibilities while mastering Python and machine learning—but every obstacle only sharpened my resolve. That leap of faith transformed me from a newcomer into a problem-solver, proving that with the right mindset, even the most unlikely beginnings can lead to extraordinary destinations.</p>

                    <h3>Professional</h3>
                </div>
                <p class="section-content">Transitioning into business development, I merged my analytical skills with strategic thinking, helping companies leverage data to drive growth. Whether identifying market opportunities or streamlining operations, I thrived at the intersection of technology and business—translating complex insights into actionable strategies. Now, as a software engineer, I bring that same holistic perspective to building solutions, ensuring they’re not just functional but impactful. My career reflects a constant thread: the drive to create, innovate, and bridge gaps between ideas and execution.</p>
